<p>Hi, I’m Sophia Pozzi. I also go by Soph, but with so much drama in the developer community, I’ll sometimes go by Soph P-O-Double Z (said in a Snoop Dogg voice). Ok, so I may not be a rapper, but I do live in Southern California where I currently lead the marketing team at a start-up software company. I have a passion to help people solve problems and I am currently driving that initiative in my role where I blossomed my penchant for product design through web and visual design, content creation, and brand identity. 
</p>

<p>In another life, I was <a href="https://i.imgsafe.org/bff391ab30.png" target="_blank">a shoemaker</a>, a personal stylist, and a <a href="https://i.imgsafe.org/bfdfed868c.jpg" target="_blank">Broadway performer in the making</a> - just not all at the same time. My current 5pm-9pm is spent developing content for my emoji app project, ideating an Alexa skill to build with <a href="https://i.imgsafe.org/c00046b8c6.jpg" target="_blank">my dog Oz</a>, practicing yoga (#WorkCanWait), taking online classes to learn web technologies (JavaScript, I’m looking at you!), and interaction design. 
</p>

<p>This unique combination of experiences and skills has conditioned me to develop out-of-the box ideas and bring them into product design and marketing at my current job. Working for a small startup has provided me with great experience; however, I’m looking to push my limits of product design and expand my development skills at a faster pace with a larger customer base. I want to drop prototypes faster than <a href="https://bananastandard.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/the-down-low.gif?w=618&h=348" target="_blank">Ice-T drops one-liners in Law & Order SVU.</a>
 </p>
 <p>I’m a liberal designer in that I seek for new behaviors and opinions on my projects, and I’m willing to discard “by-the-book” methods in order to create new product designs in which people will use and love…everyone loves a hippie right? I want to collaborate on how I can help take Basecamp to 250K+ paying customers by joining the team as a product design intern because I definitely don’t want the team’s next hashtag pledge campaign to be <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2017/01/20/why-this-tech-ceo-is-promising-to-pay-customer-refunds-from-his-own-paycheck/#a4113c723357" target="_blank">#LunchMoney4Fried.</a> </p>

<p>Best,</p>
